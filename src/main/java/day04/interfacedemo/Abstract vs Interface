**When to Use an Abstract Class:**

1. **Common Functionality:** Use an abstract class when you have a base class that provides common functionality to its subclasses. Subclasses can then extend the abstract class to inherit and specialize that common functionality.

2. **Default Implementations:** Abstract classes can provide default implementations for methods, allowing subclasses to either use or override these implementations. This is helpful when you want to provide a common behavior that can be modified if needed.

3. **Partial Implementation:** Abstract classes can have partially implemented methods. You can have abstract methods (without implementations) alongside concrete methods (with implementations). Subclasses must implement the abstract methods, but they can use the concrete methods as-is.

4. **Shared State:** Abstract classes can have instance variables, which allow you to store shared state that can be used across different methods in the class and its subclasses.

5. **Less Code Duplication:** Abstract classes can reduce code duplication among related classes by providing reusable methods and variables.

**When to Implement Interfaces:**

1. **Multiple Abilities:** Use interfaces when you want a class to have multiple abilities, like being able to perform different actions that are not related by inheritance. A class can implement multiple interfaces to gain these abilities.

2. **Unrelated Classes:** If you have unrelated classes that need to share a common behavior, implementing interfaces can be more flexible than forcing them to inherit from a common abstract class.

3. **Contractual Obligations:** Interfaces are great for defining contracts that multiple classes need to adhere to. This helps ensure consistent behavior across different classes.

4. **Different Inheritance Paths:** Java allows multiple interface implementation but only single class inheritance. If your class needs to follow different "paths" of abilities, interfaces are more suitable.

5. **Framework and Library Usage:** When working with frameworks or libraries that require your classes to fulfill specific contracts, implementing interfaces is often the preferred way to integrate your code.

**Choosing the Right Approach:**

In general, if you're looking to provide a common base for related classes with shared functionality, use an abstract class. If you want to define a contract or add specific abilities to unrelated classes, use interfaces. In many cases, you can combine both abstract classes and interfaces to create a well-structured and flexible design.

Remember that the choice between abstract classes and interfaces depends on your specific use case and the design goals of your program. It's important to understand the strengths and characteristics of each approach to make the best decision for your code.
